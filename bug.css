The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, if you don't include spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /), the calculation may not work as expected.  For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` will likely fail, whereas `width:calc(100% - 10px)` will work correctly. This error can be difficult to spot as there is no immediate visual error.
