# CSS calc() Space Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The issue arises from the lack of spaces around the operators within the calculation.  This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug problems.

The `bug.css` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

This is an uncommon CSS error that is easily missed by developers but can cause frustrating issues when working on layout.
